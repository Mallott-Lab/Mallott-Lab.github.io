Welcome to the Mallott Lab @WUSTL! 

## Research areas

Our research examines how the environment shapes host-associated microbial communities both within and across species. We are particularly interested in how the response of the gut microbiome to external factors might contribute to host health and fitness. Our current projects include:

* The influence of environmental pollutants on human gut microbiomes in collaboration with the Southern Community Cohort Study [SCCS](https://southerncommunitystudy.org)
* Interactions between the environment, parasite burden, and the human gut microbiome in collaboration with the Rural Embodiment and Child Health Study [REACH study](https://reachresearch.org)
* Examining changes in the gut microbiome across reproduction in wild nonhuman primates
* A comparative study of gut microbial SCFA metabolism across the primate order
