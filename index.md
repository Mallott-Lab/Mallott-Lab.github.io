Welcome to the Mallott Lab @WUSTL! 

## Research areas

Our research examines how the environment shapes host-associated microbial communities both within and across species. We are particularly interested in how the response of the gut microbiome to both environmental and host factors might contribute to host health and fitness. Our current projects include:

* Interactions between the environment, flooding, pathogen burden, and the human gut microbiome in collaboration with the Rural Embodiment and Community Health Study [REACH study](https://reachresearch.org)
* Examining changes in the gut microbiome across reproduction in wild nonhuman primates and pregnant people in St. Louis.
* Investigating how hybridization impacts the gut microbiome in two species of langurs in Sri Lanka as part of the [Kaludiyapokuna Primate Conservation and Research Center](https://kpcrc.org/). 
* A comparative study of gut microbial SCFA metabolism across the primate order
