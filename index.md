Welcome to the Mallott Lab @WUSTL! We are just getting started, so this website is rather bare bones for now. Check back for more information soon!

## Research areas

Our research examines how the environment shapes host-associated microbial communities both within and across species. Our current projects include:

* The influence of environmental pollutants on human gut microbiomes in collaboration with the Southern Community Cohort Study [SCCS](https://southerncommunitystudy.org)
* Interactions between the environment, parasite burden, and the human gut microbiome in collaboration with the Rural Embodiment and Child Health Study [REACH study](https://reachresearch.org)
* Examining changes in the gut microbiome across reproduction in wild nonhuman primates
* A comparative study of gut microbial SCFA metabolism across the primate order
