### Prospective Undergraduate Students

Please email Liz with your resume, a list of courses you have taken, and a brief (less than one page) description of your interests (what interests you about research in the Mallott Lab?).

### Prospective Graduate Students

Current WashU DBBS students interested in a rotation in the Mallott Lab - please email Liz to set up a time to chat about potential projects.

Prospective graduate students should apply to one of WashU's Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences graduate programs (more information can be found [here](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/)). It is helpful, but not necessary, to reach out to Liz prior to applying to discuss shared research interests (this is particularly true if you are planning to apply to the [EEB](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/ecology-evolutionary-biology/) program).

### Prospective Postdoctoral Scientists

I do not currently have any funded postdoctoral positions available in the lab. However, I am happy to discuss applying for fellowship opportunities with prospective postdocs. Please email me with your CV, a brief statement of the proposed research, and details about the fellowship application (name, link to the opportunity, due dates).
