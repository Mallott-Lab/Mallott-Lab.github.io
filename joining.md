### Prospective Undergraduate Students

Please email Liz with your resume, a list of courses you have taken, and a brief (less than one page) description of your interests (what interests you about research in the Mallott Lab?).

### Prospective Graduate Students

Current WashU DBBS students interested in a rotation in the Mallott Lab - please email Liz to set up a time to chat about potential projects.

Prospective graduate students should apply to one of WashU's Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences graduate programs (more information can be found [here](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/Pages/index.aspx)). It is helpful, but not necessary, to reach out to Liz prior to applying to discuss shared research interests (this is particularly true if you are planning to apply to the [EEPB](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx) program).

### Prospective Postdoctoral Scientists

I am currently recruiting a postdoc focusing on nonhuman primate microbiomes (though there will be opportunities to also gain experience with human gut microbiomes). Please email me (mallott (at) wustl (dot) edu) with your CV, a cover letter detailing research interests and goals, and names and contact information for three references. Additional details about the position can be found [here](https://wustl.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External/details/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate---Arts---Sciences_JR71608?q=JR71608). 

Proficiency in one or more of the following skills is preferred - general molecular and/or microbiological techniques, coding in R or Python, or analyzing sequencing data in a high-performance computing environment. In addition, experience with rt-qPCR, metagenomic library construction, in vitro fermentation, anaerobic culturing, analyzing microbiome data, and/or wild animal data collection and analysis is desirable.

I will begin reviewing applications on Jan 31st.

I am also happy to discuss applying for fellowship opportunities with prospective postdocs. Please email me with your CV, a brief statement of the proposed research, and details about the fellowship application (name, link to the opportunity, due dates).
