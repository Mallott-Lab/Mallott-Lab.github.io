Carlye Chaney is an NSF SBE Postdoctoral Fellow in the Mallott Laboratory, where she is investigating how pesticides and other environmental contaminants may influence childhood metabolic development. As part of this work, she is exploring how microbiome composition and diversity may mediate the relationship between environmental exposures and thyroid function. Carlye received her PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 2023, and her PhD research investigated the experiences and biological consequences of exposure to environmental contaminants among mothers and infants from Namqom, Formosa, Argentina, and New Haven, Connecticut. When not in the lab, Carlye enjoys crocheting, running, and reading fantasy / science fiction novels.

Liz is interested in understanding host-associated microbiome variation within and between species. Liz majored in both Biology and Music at Grinnell College (2006) and has a PhD in Anthropology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2016). She was a postdoc at Northwestern University, Dartmouth College, and Vanderbilt University before starting at WUSTL in 2022.

Shan is a senior double majoring in Global Studies and Biology. They are interested in understanding the gut microbiome as a mediator between structural inequality and human health, as well as incorporating environmental interventions into community healthcare. In the lab, Shan is investigating the association between flood exposure, fecal microbiome diversity, and host immune response as part of the REACH study. In their free time, they enjoy running, baking, and chess.
