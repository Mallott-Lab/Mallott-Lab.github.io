Liz is interested in understanding host-associated microbiome variation within and between species. Liz majored in both Biology and Music at Grinnell College (2006) and has a PhD in Anthropology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2016). She was a postdoc at Northwestern University, Dartmouth College, and Vanderbilt University before starting at WUSTL in 2022.

Kaylaa is a first-year majoring in biology and chemistry. While she has always been fascinated by research and analytics, she only recently stumbled across microbiology during her senior year of high school. Research at the University of Cincinnati sparked an interest in microbial genetics; Kaylaa continues to be amazed by how microbes can both cause and resolve leading global issues. However, she is also excited to explore synthetic biology and chemistry more broadly while at WashU. In the lab, Kaylaa is examining the possible association of host diet or phylogeny with the gut microbiome of platyrrhine monkeys. In her free time, she enjoys doing puzzles, riding her bike, and writing poetry.
